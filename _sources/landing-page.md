## Welcome to the BoBiAC Book

Welcome to the [BoBiAC](https://iac.hms.harvard.edu/bobiac/2025/) Book — your resource for the [Boston BioImage Analysis Course (BoBiAC)](https://iac.hms.harvard.edu/bobiac/2025/).
<br>
This book is designed for **beginners** and provides a **hands-on introduction to image analysis using Python**. Inside, you’ll find everything you need to follow the course: lecture slides, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and step-by-step guidance through the material.

### Lecture Slides

All `Lecture Slides` within the book are available for download as PDFs.
<br>
You can download the complete slide decks from the [Course Materials Downloads](data/course_downloads.md) section of this book.
<br>
Additionally, each individual page that contains lecture slides has a `Download this Slides` button at the top for convenient access to slides for that specific topic.

### Jupyter Notebooks

All the `Jupyter Notebooks` within the book are available to download.
<br>
You can download the complete list of notebooks from the [Course Materials Downloads](data/course_downloads.md) section of this book.
<br>
Additionally, each individual page that contains Jupyter Notebooks has a `Download this Notebook` button at the top for convenient access to that specific notebook. All the notebooks can also be opened with `Google Colab` using the `Open in Colab` button at the top of each notebook page.

#### How to run the Notebooks

All the Notebooks are designed to be used with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and [juv](https://github.com/manzt/juv) to avoid the need to deal with Python environments.

After installing `uv` you can run the following commands in your terminal to open the notebooks with Jupyter Lab in your browser:

```bash
uvx juv run path/to/your/notebook.ipynb
```

If you did install `juv`, you can simply run:

```bash
juv run path/to/your/notebook.ipynb
```

### Course Datasets

All the datasets used in this book are available to download from the [Course Materials Downloads](./data/course_downloads.md) section.
