[default.extend-words]
# Add words that should be ignored by typos checker
# Format: "typo" = "typo" (tells typos this is intentional)
# or "typo" = "correct_spelling" (tells typos to suggest the correct spelling)

# Example entries:
# "segmentastion" = "segmentation"  # Will suggest "segmentation" 
# "eords" = "eords"  # Will ignore "eords" as intentional

# Library names that should not be corrected
"nd2" = "nd2"  # Ignore nd2 library name (don't convert to "and2")
"nd" = "nd"    # Ignore "nd" when used in technical contexts

"ba" = "ba"
"caf" = "caf"
"ede" = "ede"
