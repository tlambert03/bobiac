## Welcome to the BoBiAC Book

## The Jupyter Notebooks

The `Jupyter Notebooks` within this book are available to download. Each of them has a `Download this notebook` at the top of the page.


All the Notebooks are designed to be used with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and [juv](https://github.com/manzt/juv) to avoid the need to deal with Python environments. Detailed instruction can be found in the [Getting Started with Python](./content/getting_started_with_python/getting_started_with_python.md) section of this book.
