# Segmentation using Ilastik (Machine Learning)

Machine learning is a computational approach where algorithms identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data rather than explicit programming. Supervised machine learning, specifically, involves training algorithms using labeled examples, allowing them to classify new, unseen data accurately.

In this context, we will use [**Ilastik**](https://www.ilastik.org), a **free**, **open-source** software tool designed for **interactive image analysis**, including tasks such as **segmentation** and **classification**, without requiring prior expertise in machine learning or programming.

At its core, **Ilastik** employs supervised machine learning techniques. **Users annotate images by labeling regions of interest**, and the software **trains a classifier** (typically a Random Forest algorithm) **to recognize patterns and distinguish between different classes within the images**.

The software is well-documented, with comprehensive resources available [here](https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/).

## Download and Install Ilastik

**Ilastik** as available as an application with a **graphical user interface (GUI)**. The latest version can be downloaded [here](https://www.ilastik.org/downloads/). Select the appropriate version depending on the operating system (e.g. Windows, MacOS). The installation process is straightforward and typically involves running an installer or dragging the application to the Applications folder (on MacOS).
