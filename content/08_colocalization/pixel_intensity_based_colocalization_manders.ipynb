To handle this, the function automatically pads non-square images to square dimensions with zeros before applying rotations, ensuring that all transformations maintain the same image size and allow valid statistical comparisons.\n",

    "The **image translation randomization** test is a statistical method used to **validate the significance of colocalization results**, particularly for Mander's coefficients. This method involves **randomly translating one channel relative to another and recalculating the Mander's coefficients** to create a distribution of values under the null hypothesis of no colocalization.\n",

    "**Key Considerations for Mander's Correlation Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Threshold Sensitivity**: Mander's coefficients are **highly sensitive to thresholding methods**. The choice of thresholding strategy will significantly impact your results, making careful threshold selection essential for accurate colocalization analysis. Consider using:\n",
    "   - **Automated thresholding methods** (like Costes auto-threshold): these are fully automated and don't require you to select or tune any parameters\n",
    "   - **Threshold calculation algorithms** (like Otsu, Li, Triangle, Yen, etc.): these automatically calculate a threshold value, but you need to choose which algorithm to use based on your image characteristics and how the resulting threshold looks\n",
    "   - **Consistent thresholding**: use the same thresholding approach across experimental conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Background Considerations**: sometimes it is necessary to apply appropriate image preprocessing steps before calculating Mander's coefficients such as Background subtraction to remove non-specific signal or Flat-field correction to account for illumination variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical Validation**: always validate your results using statistical tests such as the image rotation test or the image translation randomization test demonstrated above. This helps assess whether observed colocalization is statistically significant or could have occurred by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparative Analysis**: Mander's coefficients should not be interpreted as absolute values in isolation. Instead, consider them in the context of:\n",
    "   - Comparisons between different experimental conditions\n",
    "   - Control vs. treatment groups\n",
    "   - Different time points or developmental stages\n",
    "   - Relative changes between conditions are often more meaningful than absolute values\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Asymmetry Interpretation**: remember that M1 ≠ M2 is common and biologically meaningful.\n",
    "   - **M1**: Fraction of channel 1 intensity that overlaps with channel 2\n",
    "   - **M2**: Fraction of channel 2 intensity that overlaps with channel 1\n",
    "   - This asymmetry can reveal important biological relationships between the labeled structures"
