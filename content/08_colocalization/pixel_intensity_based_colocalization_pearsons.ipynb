    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note on Spatial Information:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to understand that **Pearson's correlation works on vectors/pairs of values and does not use spatial information at all**. The correlation is calculated based purely on the intensity values and their relationships, regardless of where those pixels are located in the image. This means that if you randomly shuffle the pixel positions in both channels in exactly the same way, you would get identical Pearson's correlation results. This characteristic makes Pearson's correlation fundamentally different from spatial colocalization measures and emphasizes that it's measuring intensity co-variation rather than spatial co-occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Considerations for Pearson's Correlation Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Region of Interest (ROI) Analysis**: Instead of running Pearson's correlation on the entire image, it is often beneficial to perform **segmentation of the structures you care about** first. Ideally, use a **third independent channel** (such as a nuclear stain or cell membrane marker) to define regions of interest. This approach:\n",
    "   - Reduces background noise interference\n",
    "   - Focuses analysis on biologically relevant areas\n",
    "   - Improves the biological interpretation of results\n",
    "   - Eliminates correlation artifacts from empty regions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Background Considerations**: Pearson's correlation can be heavily influenced by background pixels. Consider applying background subtraction or flat-field correction before analysis, or use segmentation masks to exclude background regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical Validation**: Always validate your results using statistical tests such as the Costes pixel randomization test demonstrated above. This helps assess whether observed correlations are statistically significant or could have occurred by chance. Rotating 90 or 180 degrees one channel and computing Pearson's correlation can also help validate the significance of the observed correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Costes Test**: This test generates a distribution of Pearson's coefficients from randomized pixel intensities, allowing you to calculate a p-value for your observed correlation. A low p-value indicates that the observed correlation is unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparative Analysis**: Pearson's correlation values should not be interpreted as absolute measures in isolation. Instead, consider them in the context of:\n",
    "   - Comparisons between different experimental conditions\n",
    "   - Control vs. treatment groups\n",
    "   - Different time points or developmental stages\n",
    "   - Relative changes between conditions are often more meaningful than absolute values\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Limitations**: Remember that Pearson's correlation measures **linear relationships** between pixel intensities. It may not capture more complex colocalization patterns and can be sensitive to outliers and intensity variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining proper image preprocessing, ROI-based analysis, and statistical validation, Pearson's correlation coefficient becomes a powerful tool for quantitative colocalization analysis in fluorescence microscopy."
